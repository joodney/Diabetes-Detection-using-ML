# **Diabetes Detection Using Machine Learning**

This repository contains the implementation of various machine learning algorithms to detect diabetes in the implementation of what we, students of king Abdul-Aziz univesrity, computuer scinece students, learned over the course of Artificial Intellignce topics of CPCS433. The aim is to analyze the dataset, preprocess the data, and apply ML techniques for effective diabetes prediction.
This work is presented to Dr. Nahed Al-owaidi

## **Repository Structure**

### **Main Branch** (Machine Learning Algorithms)
The main branch contains four Jupyter notebooks, each implementing a different machine learning algorithm for diabetes detection:
1. **`DiabetesDetection_LogisticRegression.ipynb`** - Logistic Regression implementation.
2. **`DiabetesDetection_SVM.ipynb`** - Support Vector Machine implementation.
3. **`DiabetesDetection_DecisionTree.ipynb`** - Decision Tree implementation.
4. **`DiabetesDetection_RandomForest.ipynb`** - Random Forest implementation.

### **Dataset Branch**
The `dataset` branch includes:
- **`diabetes_dataset.csv`**: The dataset used for training and testing the models.

---

## **Dataset Overview**
The dataset used in this project contains features such as:
- **Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant.
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration.
- **Blood Pressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
- **Skin Thickness**: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index.
- **Diabetes Pedigree Function**: A function that indicates the likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
- **Age**: Age of the patient.
- **Outcome**: Binary outcome (1 = Diabetes, 0 = No Diabetes).

## **Algorithms and Techniques**
Each notebook demonstrates:
1. Data preprocessing (e.g., handling missing values, normalization).
2. Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Model training and evaluation (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

## **How to Run**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/joodney/Diabetes-Detection-using-ML.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```bash
   cd Diabetes-Detection-using-ML
   ```
3. Open any `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab to explore the code for different ML algorithms.
